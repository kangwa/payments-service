"""SOAP port for the accounts domain (future implementation).

This package will contain SOAP web service definitions and handlers for legacy
system integration. The SOAP interface will enable interoperability with
enterprise systems requiring SOAP/XML-based communication.

Note:
    This is a placeholder for future implementation. The SOAP port will provide:
    - XML-based web service endpoints
    - WSDL service definitions
    - Support for legacy system integration
    - Enterprise security standards compatibility
