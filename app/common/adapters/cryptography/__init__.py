Cryptography infrastructure adapters implementing common security interfaces.

Provides concrete implementations for:
- Password hashing using Argon2 algorithm
- JWT token generation and validation
- Cryptographic utilities for authentication workflows

Implements interfaces from `common.interfaces.password_hasher` and 
`common.interfaces.token_manager` with production-ready cryptography solutions.
